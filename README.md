Bindings and implementation for mutable JavaScript `ArrayBuffer`s.

An `ArrayBuffer` is a built-in JavaScript object for storage of a flat continuous
region of memory.

The `Typed` module provides a view into an `ArrayBuffer` for array
access of aligned local-machine-endian types, for in-process flat memory operations.

The `DataView` module provides a view into an `ArrayBuffer` for inter-process
flat memory operations.

* [MDN `ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer)
* [ECMA-262 `ArrayBuffer`](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/structured-data.html#sec-arraybuffer-objects)


## Installation

Install `arraybuffer` with [Spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago):

```sh
spago install arraybuffer
```

## Documentation

`arraybuffer` documentation is stored in a few places:

1. Module documentation is [published on Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-arraybuffer).
2. Written documentation is kept in the [docs directory](./docs).
3. Usage examples can be found in [the test suite](./test).

If you get stuck, there are several ways to get help:

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-arraybuffer/issues) if you have encountered a bug or problem.
- Ask general questions on the [PureScript Discourse](https://discourse.purescript.org) forum or the [PureScript Discord](https://purescript.org/chat) chat.

## Usage

### Polyfill

This library relies on runtime implementations of
[`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer)
and
[`DataView`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView)
([Structured Data](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/structured-data.html#sec-structured-data)),
and
[`TypedArray`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray)
([Indexed Collections](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/indexed-collections.html#sec-indexed-collections)).

If you want to be sure that those implementations are available in your target
runtime environment, you might want to consider using a polyfill such as
[__core-js__ Typed Arrays](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js#ecmascript-typed-arrays).
